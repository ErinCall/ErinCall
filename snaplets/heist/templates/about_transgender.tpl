    <h3>About My Being Transgender</h3>
    <p>
        You may have known me as Andrew Lorente. It has become evident a female identity suits me much better, and I'm in the process of structuring my life to express that. If you haven't had transgender acquaintances before, or you'd like to know more about what it means for me, this information may be of interest to you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I prefer the name that's all over this website, Erin Call.</li>
        <li>I prefer female pronouns: she, her, etc.</li>
        <li>If you realize midsentence that you've used the wrong name or pronoun, you may wonder if you should correct yourself or if you should push through, to avoid making things awkward. I would prefer that you correct yourself. It takes practice to make the switch; an "oops, I meant..." shows you're trying.</li>
        <li>If some third party gets a name/pronoun wrong, you might wonder if correcting them is standing up for me, or if it's talking for me or stealing my thunder. It's the former, and I really appreciate it!</li>
        <li>I am working with a trans-positive therapist to make sure I'm on a healthy trajectory.</li>
        <li>I've only understood this about myself fairly recently. However, I've spent most of my life feeling antipathy toward masculine gender roles and attraction toward feminine ones. I'm pretty smart, but somehow it took me until I was 30 to put those pieces together.</li>
        <li>My "Andrew Lorente" email addresses will remain active indefinitely. Still, I'd appreciate you using <a href="mailto:hello@erincall.com">hello@erincall.com</a>.</li>
        <li>If you have questions about my genitals, you should keep them to yourself. I understand your curiosity! You're gonna have to suck it up and deal, though.</li>
        <li>There are some words in common parlance that aren't ok to use for me. These include "transvestite," "cross-dresser," and "tranny."</li>
        <li>I really appreciate your support! Even small things, like using the correct name or pronoun, make a flower bloom in my heart.</li>
    </ul>
