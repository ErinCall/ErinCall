    <h3>Small Languages</h3>
    <p>This is a talk I gave to the PDXPython user group on 2014-04-23. It covers the concepts involved in building parsers for domain-specific languages. If you want to follow along with the slides, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h7eis8gvcSTi17Skl2MDXQSuZnnn9MEobz0DpWa4Zyw/edit?usp=sharing">they're shared as a Google Docs presentation.</a></p>

    <p>I'm sorry about the way the video cuts out in the midst of the Q&amp;A. My camera apparently only records 25 minutes of video at one go. I'm told this is more about tariff categories than technological limits, which is frustrating.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in learning more about the parser-generator libraries available in python, I prepared some <a href="https://github.com/ErinCall/parser-demos">supplemental material</a> that you might find interesting.</p>
