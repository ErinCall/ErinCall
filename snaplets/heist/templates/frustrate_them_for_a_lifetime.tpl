    <div>Why should you want newbies?</div>
    <div>
      We have ludicrously low unemployment in programming right now:
      <ul>
        <li>1%-2.5%, depending on search term</li>
        <li>The Federal Reserve estimates 5% would be healthy</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>Extremely low unemployment sounds great, but in fact it causes a lot of problems.</div>

    <div>So why should newbies need help? People teach themselves programming all the time.</div>
    <div>Stackoverflow is full of well-intentioned errors.</div>
    <div>Programming environments can throw you into a rabbit hole without warning.</div>
    <div>Step 1: draw some circles. <br> Step 2: draw the rest of the owl.</div>

    <div>Ok, so how do I help mentor people?</div>

    <div>Tell them they aren't stupid.</div>
    <div>Give them something to do.</div>
